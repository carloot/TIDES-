# TIDES-
# Project Idea 
All of us know about existence of tides and everyone is familiar with the difference between high tides and low tides. Nevertheless, how many of us know why it occurs? Who could explain how such a fascinating phenomenon works? 
Starting from these questions, we attempted to create an experience that allows the user to understand the causes and the consequences of the tides’ phenomenon, by making the connection between its origins (the mutual position of the sun, the earth and the moon) and its manifestation, extremely focused. This latter is represented by the change of the level of water that we already know. 
In order to make this representation as clear as we can, we have decided to change our interaction making the user more involved.  We have established to give to the user the possibility to choose among five different places on the earth (represented by colourful points on the map) and to show the different change of the level of the sea in various parts of the world. 
# The interaction 
The type of interaction, established with the user, is really simple.  In order to change the place, you can easily click on the name of the countries that are positioned on the top of the screen. On the contrary, in order to raise and to reduce the water, it is enough to press the mouse on the earth. Moreover, depending on the mutual position of sun, earth and moon, a certain water level will be visible. 
# The style 
Despite of our choice to portray this phenomenon in a simple and minimal way, we focused on the way in which the countries have been represented. Thus, we have tried to make each country recognizable through the choice of different colours palettes, with the intention to evoke the particular atmosphere of each site. 
# Difficulties and References 
The main problems, met in our sketch, have been: 
making the moon rotate around the earth, following a circular trajectory.  After a focus on this point by watching some YouTube tutorials, we have found a solution due to a link of youtube.

associating the rotation of the moon to the movement of water: in this way they are connected to each other. We solved this problem by using some “if” for the function “mouseIsPressed” in order to connect the rotation (var angle) to another variable (called Andrea) that changed the different values of the wave.
